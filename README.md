# Project: Rafflr

![Main page for application](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80722863/174458236-969fa702-4e02-4e65-873d-8dde6e36a21c.png)

Welcome! This is an app for [Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se) that lets you pick raffle winners without any headaches! It uses a custom built [API](https://github.com/Blissblass/toyhouse_rails_api) to fetch and then process data for raffle characters.

Check the app out [here!](https://erayalkis.github.io/toyhouse_raffle_app)

# Usage

Using this app is really simple! You only need the link of the raffle character. After pasting it in the input, you can load all the data for the participants, and edit participant data freely! (The app *will* detect abnormal changes, so please don't use it unfairly!)

## Sample Links:

Since [Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se) is currently an invite only app, sample links are necessary to test the app without an account. Here's a few, even though they aren't raffle characters:
* https://toyhou.se/37323.soggy-bread
* https://toyhou.se/5873555.deity
* https://toyhou.se/8583538.after-school-pride-flags
* https://toyhou.se/5450876.devil


## Technologies used

This app is written in Vue and plain Javascript for the fetch code and uses CSS3 for styling. 
[My own Toyhouse API](https://github.com/Blissblass/toyhouse_rails_api) was used to gather all the necessary data for the characters.
